				The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia. It was founded on 15 January 2001 as Wikipedia's first edition and, as of June 2021, has the most articles of any edition, at 6,359,815.[2] As of August 2021, 11% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3][4] The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021.[5] The English Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of democratization of knowledge and extent of coverage.[6]
